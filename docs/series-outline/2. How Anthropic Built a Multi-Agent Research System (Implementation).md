# How Anthropic Built a Multi-Agent Research System (Implementation)


## Learning objective
By the end of this video, you will be able to build your first simple multi-agent system using anthropic's `claude-agents-sdk` without confusion.`

*Note*: **This will be using the same method that anthropic used to build their own researcher agent!**


**Prerequisites**: 
- Basic knowledge of `python`
- Recommended: watch [Building Your First Simple Multi-Agent System (Conceptual)](./2.Building Your First Simple Multi-Agent System - Concepts.md) first.
